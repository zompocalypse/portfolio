    <!-- About Me -->
    <section id="about">
      <!-- using border-top class to add horizontal rule to create distinct sections -->
      <h3 class="border-top">About</h3>
        <p>After spending 18 years in customer-facing roles and leading customer-facing teams, I started my journey at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> to become a software developer.  I have always had a knack for:</p>
        <!-- unordered list to highlight some of my professional qualities -->
        <ul>
          <li>Truly understanding and being empathetic towards colleagues and customers</li>
          <li>Believing every customer matters</li>
          <li>Being a leader, not a boss!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I like to see myself as a lifelonger learner and truly believe you learn something from every interaction, whether it is a success of a failure.  Part of the human condition is making connections with other people and, if we are lucky, we can grow from those interactions.</a>

        <p>If you're interested in hiring a new developer with a high EQ, leadership experience, and plenty of customer-facing experience, please reach out!</p>
